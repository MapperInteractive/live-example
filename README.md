[![Deploy to Heroku](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.png)](https://heroku.com/deploy)

## What's this?

This is an example project of MapperCore. We recommend that you fork this repo and customize it as you need.

## How it Works

First, you need a Heroku account. [Sign up here](https://signup.heroku.com/) if you don't have one.
Heroku offers free website hosting and easy deployment.

If you put your Mapper project in a private Github repository, you need to [connect it to Heroku](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/github-integration) before deployment.

If you haven't deployed it before, you can click the above "Deploy to Heroku" button. We recomend you enable [automatic deploys](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/github-integration#automatic-deploys). So that, once new code is pushed to github, Heroku will automatically deploy it for you.

Heroku offers monthly free hours enough for you to run a project without paying. For details, please checkout [Apps Free Resources on Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/free).
